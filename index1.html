  <h1>Welcome To My Website!</h1>
  <p>This website was created as an introduction for my students and parents to get to know me. I have included some things about my life in this website, including my hobbies and favorite places that I have visited. Above are navigational links that will help you easily navigate my website. I have also added a chart of places that I have visited in the U.S. to show my love for traveling and seeing new things.  Also, in my "About Me" I have added a numbered list of my favorite activities that I like to do in my free time. I have really enjoyed being a 3rd grade teacher! I have learned a lot about how to relate to students and how to help them learn.  Technology today has really evolved the way that we teach.  I use a lot of online resources to help students excel in their education and also resources for both parents and teachers to easily access.</p>
  
<h2> About Me</h2>
    
<p>  Hello, my name is Brittany Dozier and I am currently a third grade math and reading teacher at Page School center in Pineville, Ky. I am currently working towards my library science rank 1. My dream is to become a reading facilitator at my current school and part-time librarian. Our libararians in our district perform several roles under the title of their job. One of those jobs is being the reading facilitator for the SFA reading program in our district to promote student learning and progression of reading skills in grades K-8. I have been married for 12 1/2 years and live in Pineville, KY. My husband is an insurance broker who works independantly with my father in their growing health/ life insurance business.

    <p>In my free time I love to be outdoors, hiking, kayaking or swimming.  I also love to travel to different states and visit the national parks.  I love to attend church and be involved in church activities,this past Monday we all enjoyed a church four wheeler ride for Memorial Day. </p>

<p>I really enjoy seeing new places and traveling when I am on summer break.  I have been blessed enough to have visited many places in the USA.  My all time favorite was Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon.  Returning to these areas is definitley something I want to do in the near future. My favorite place to visit is the west part of the U.S. I loved seeing the Red Rock Canyons and hiking around The Grand Canyon's south rim. Traveling allows you to explore new cultures as well as new areas and their traditions. After visting these places I do have a favorite- Utah was by far the most beautiful place that I have ever seen ins the U.S. The rich colors of the rocks and mountains was truly amazing. Also, the vast size of the mountains and canyons was breath taking.  If you have never seen the west, it's a must see!! Below is a google map of my favorite place to visit- I loved visiting Utah!!!</p>

<p>Welcome to Page School Centers Library!! I am so excited to share with you all that we offer to both the parents and students of our wildcat family.  Our school provides students not only with a wide range of books and materials at their finger tips but also with technology and many other resources to promote learning.  Students now have free access to the MobyMax program which is a great resource for those struggling with reading and other subjects as well.  This program is designed to specifically tailor to each studentsâ€™ needs by giving them a placement test and then reteaching them things needed. This program reports scores and reports to the teacher. Another program provided by our school library is the member center portal. Teachers use this portal to record the SFA reading scores and implementation goals to the principal, librarian facilitator and the district. This program is one that has been used to keep data for students and also for the librarian to see that students are being placed in the proper reading group.  Any students that are not making progress can then be reevaluated and moved to the proper reading group. Your child is bound for success with our top teachers and administrative staff to help them excel in all their learning goals and academic challenges.My goal is to see students be successful both academically and intellectually.  Helping students find their creative side and understand their interests are all a part of developing both socially and emotionally. I am here to help students explore possibilities and to help them find what it is they would like to achieve.  Being the best that they can be in every way is our motto here at Page School Center.

At our school we love using the KYVL!!!
